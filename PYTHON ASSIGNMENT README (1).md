Fast Food Consumption & Health Impact Project:

Objective:
Analyze the health impact of fast food consumption using Python.  
The project calculates health risk based on calories, BMI, and other factors, and demonstrates basic Python concepts.


1.Dataset Description:
File: `fast_food_consumption_health_impact_dataset.csv`
Columns:
    *Age
    *Gender
    *Fast_Food_Meals_Per_Week
    *Average_Daily_Calories
    *BMI
    *Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Week
    *Sleep_Hours_Per_Day
    *Energy_Level_Score
    *Digestive_Issues
    *Doctor_Visits_Per_Year
    *Overall_Health_Score


2.Steps Implemented

1. Step 1 & 2:Load dataset and convert it into a list of dictionaries for easy processing.
2. Step 3:Create a menu-driven program to interact with the user.
3. Step 4:Defined functions to:
    - View records
    - Search records by gender
    - Perform health risk analysis
    - Save data to file
4. Step 5:Use conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to classify health risk based on calories.
5. Step 6:Demonstrate Python built-in methods:
    - List methods (`len()`, slicing)
    - Dictionary methods (`keys()`, `get()`)
    - String methods (`upper()`)
6. Step 7:Implement exception handling (`try-except`) for invalid user inputs.
7. Step 8:Save the processed data to a JSON file using file handling methods.


3.How to Run:

1. Open `fast_food_health.py` or `fast_food_health.ipynb`.
2. Run Step 2:first to load the dataset.
3. Run Step 4:to define all functions.
4. Run Step 3:to display the menu and interact with the program.
5. Execute steps 5–8 as needed for analysis and file saving.
6. The output will be saved to `health_analysis_output.json`.


4.Files in Submission

Step 2:Dataset loaded successfully
Step 3: Menu displayed
Step 4: Functions executed
Step 5: Health risk calculation output
Step 6:Method outputs (list, dict, string)
Step 7: Exception handling (valid & invalid input)
Step 8: File saved confirmation and sample output


5.Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates:

- Loading and processing a dataset in Python
- Menu-driven user interaction
- Functions for repetitive tasks
- Conditional statements for decision-making
- Python methods for data manipulation
- Exception handling for safe input
- File handling to save processed output

It provides a clear example of using Python for data analysis and health risk evaluation** based on fast food consumption.
